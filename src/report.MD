Because of the current state of affairs and our own personal emergencies,
we did not complete a report.  We did however spend a lot of time working
on reading a file into a dataframe and we would appreciate any feedback
the TA's or professors could provide.

The relevant code is in src/cli/parser.h.

Thanks for everything in this difficult time.
